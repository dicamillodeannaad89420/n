Some of the codes have been used for the [ICLR'15 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6856.pdf) Object Detectors Emerge in Deep Scene CNNs. You can use this toolkit with the naive [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe), with matcaffe and pycaffe compiled, or [pyTorch](http://pytorch.org/). This toolkit includes the following functions:",
